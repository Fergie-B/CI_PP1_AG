## Design

### Design Choices
The websites pages where designed to contrast between the different sections allowing the end user to find what they are looking for easily and intuitively. It uses a bold Green colour scheme to reflect the idea of the outdoors ideology of the brand name Apex Gym.

### Colours
The color scheme was chosen on [Coolors.co](https://coolors.co/1a3409-444444-e0dfe2-1e855c-f6f3f3) to reflect the Gyms bright green branding theme. The #444444 Body Text was tested for legibility on the [WebAIM Contrast Checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to make sure the contrast of the colours chosen for the text worked against the Bright Green Theme.

### Fonts

[Teko](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Teko/tester?query=tek) from the [Indian Type Foundry](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Indian%20Type%20Foundry) a display font on Google Fonts was chosen for the Site Headings.

For the Body text [Hind](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hind?query=hind) which is also from the [Indian Type Foundry](https://fonts.google.com/?query=Indian%20Type%20Foundry) was utilised. Hind is a solid choice for UI design, and a wise selection for electronic display embedding.

### Logo
The Two-colour website logo was designed in Adobe Illustrator using the Teko Font and was outputed as an SVG to keep the image lightweight to speed up loading times.
